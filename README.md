"# ifarse"

Created due to being unable to book a Parking spott most days at my place of work
A Parking first come first served site was created.

This Exploits a Vulrability I found in the date picker and changes the Parkign status to one of a 'Preffered User Status'

Just Download and within Chrome settings - Extensions, Load unpacked and navigate to folder.
This will then load the Extension, With a small wheel in the top right of the Browser.


*This will kick out the last Person to book a spot Previously
*I created this just for fun and this is not in use. I wanted to create a Chrome Extensions and this was a perfect fit.
